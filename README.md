# Calculator

This is a test of my Javascript, HTML, and CSS capabilities up to this point in the curriculum of TheOdinProject. HTML and CSS are not exactly the focus here though, as that will come more into focus later. The main point here is nailing the functionality of the calculator with Javascript.

# Functionality

The functionality of this calculator is a mimic of the calculator on my android phone at the time of this writing. To the best of my knowledge I have at least reproduced the functionality as it works on Android. It does not include advanced mathematical functionality, but instead contains a few "fun" buttons.

# CSS

After tackling all the functionality basic calculator design, I have updated the CSS to make a presentable calculator.
